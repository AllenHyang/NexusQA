The following is the output from the log checking script (`node check_logs.js`):

---
!{node check_logs.js}
---

Instructions:

1. **If the output indicates "No active issues found" (or similar success message):**
   - Reply with "✅ **No active issues found.**" (and nothing else).

2. **If the output lists errors:**
   - **Step 1: Analyze.** Examine the error messages to understand the problem (e.g., missing files, syntax errors, network failures, logic bugs).
   - **Step 2: Investigate.** Use your tools (like `read_file`, `search_file_content`, `codebase_investigator`) to locate the problematic code or configuration.
   - **Step 3: Fix.** If the fix is clear and you are confident, use your tools (like `replace` or `write_file`) to apply the fix immediately.
   - **Step 4: Report.** Briefly list the errors found and the actions you took (or recommend taking) to resolve them.
