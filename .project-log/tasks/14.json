  "description": "## Context\nCurrently, `TestRun` links directly to `TestCase`. If a test case is updated (e.g., steps changed), historical test runs will point to the new version, invalidating the audit trail.\n\n## Objective\nImplement a 'Snapshot' mechanism where the state of a Test Case (title, steps, etc.) is copied into the `TestRun` at the time of creation.\n\n## Scope\n1.  **Database Schema**:\n    *   Update `TestRun` model to add `snapshot` field (String/JSON).\n2.  **API**:\n    *   Update `POST /api/plans/[planId]/cases` to fetch and store case data as a snapshot.\n3.  **UI (Frontend)**:\n    *   Update `types.ts` to reflect the new field.\n    *   (Optional) Update UI to indicate if a case has changed since execution (comparison logic), or simply rely on the snapshot for historical viewing.\n\n## Dependencies\n*   Task 13 (Test Plan Architecture) - Completed\n",
