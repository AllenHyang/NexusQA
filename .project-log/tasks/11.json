  "description": "Integrate Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) principles into the NexusQA project lifecycle as mandated by the updated direction. This involves updating documentation, UI/UX design processes, and E2E testing practices to strictly follow the Given-When-Then pattern.\n\n**Objectives:**\n1.  **Process Update**: Update `NexusQA_SOP.md` and related docs to explicitly include BDD (Given-When-Then) templates for User Stories and Test Scenarios.\n2.  **UI/Interaction Redesign**: Review core UI flows (Project/Suite/Case management) and ensure they map clearly to BDD scenarios.\n3.  **Test Refactoring**: Refactor `tests/e2e/core-flows.spec.ts` to structure tests using BDD semantics (Feature -> Scenario -> Given/When/Then steps).\n\n**Acceptance Criteria (BDD Style):**\n-   **Given** the NexusQA SOP document, **When** a user reads the \"Test Scenario\" section, **Then** they should see clear guidelines and examples of using Given-When-Then syntax.\n-   **Given** the `core-flows.spec.ts` file, **When** a developer runs the tests, **Then** the test output/descriptions should read like BDD scenarios.\n-   **Given** the core UI components, **When** reviewing interactions, **Then** the state transitions should align with defined BDD scenarios.",
